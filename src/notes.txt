In the morg http client you can get the world position. For traveling larger distances, I could find the world position of where i want to go and my current world position. From there I could move a random number of tiles in a direction that I want to go.
I'm not sure how that would work for cross map travel but it would work for things like blood runes without having to setup weird trails of marked tiles

_locate_spells is in the window object
